# üå¶Ô∏è React Weather Forecast Application

The Weather Forecast app helps you get the weather forecast for your current location for the next 5 days. You have the option to get the weather forecast in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. The application has an adaptive design, that is, the interface adapts to the layout of the device, making it easier to use, navigate and search for information. In addition, the background image changes dynamically for each city entered.
